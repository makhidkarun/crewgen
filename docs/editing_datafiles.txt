Using datafiles
===============

The binaries refer to a "data" directory relative to the binary. So, if you
place the binary in /home/me/bin/<binary>, then you need to put the datafiles
into /home/me/bin/data/. 

The datafiles can have blank lines and comments that begin with "#". Any other
line will be consumed and used as data.

There is a feature recommendation for allowing the program to be given a 
specific directory for datafiles. For the moment, the best solution is to 
make a copy of the current datafile, and then edit it to your heart's conent.

The name files are just one unicode name per line. The careers and jobs files
have explinations in the file header.
