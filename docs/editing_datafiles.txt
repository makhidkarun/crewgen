Using datafiles
===============

The binaries refer to a "data" directory relative to the binary. So, if you
place the binary in /home/me/bin/<binary>, then you need to put the datafiles
into /home/me/bin/data/. 

The datafiles can have blank lines and comments that begin with "#". Any other
line will be consumed and used as data.

There is a feature recommendation for allowing the program to be given a 
specific directory for datafiles.
