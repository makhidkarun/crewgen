# Planned State


{cli, web, api} passes person.MakePerson a map of string person options, and 
person.MakePerson returns a person object.


That gets passed back to the {cli, web, api}, to be optionally passed 
a template.

The template has an output format for a person, and optionally an output
format for a group of people (ship crew, fire team, village).
